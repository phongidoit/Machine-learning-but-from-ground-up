# Machine-learning-but-from-ground-up
for CS115, UIT
Everything in this respo is exercise for my Math in Computer Science Class in College.
This should covered the concept of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,... but just the basic, don't expect it to be the perfect or good, I'm still learning.

Feel free to use for any kind of purpose.
